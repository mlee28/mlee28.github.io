			<p>In Tetris, the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible. The two ways to get the most points are with tetrises and T-spins.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To complete a T-spin, a shape like this must be made:</li>
				<li><img src="shape.png" width=200px></li>
				<li>The T piece must be dropped into this shape sideways, and then rotated to fit it in.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="example_1">
			<p>The difference between a T-spin and just placing a T is that the T-piece must be rotated into the shape.</p>
			<img src="t_locked.png" width=150>
			<p>Notice that this T-piece cannot move after being rotated. The T-piece also had to be rotated into this shape; therefore, this counts as a T-spin. Notice that 3/4 of the corners around the T-piece are filled.</p>
